# What was the most unexpectedly hard part of working in a team?



# How did you explain what you were doing to non-data-y people?
The most important part of explaining, I found, was to emphasize the difference between "data" (as in contents of a database or `.csv` file) and "graphics" (as in instructions for a renderer to draw a picture _with_ that data) 

# What did you build?
We built a pokedex. We showed pokemon stats and especially _relative_ stats, how a pokemon measures up to the distribution. 

# What new skill did you have to teach yourself specifically for this project?
A lot of flask and heroku sunk costs, and figuring out renderers for plotly and vegalite. Since each other those amount to running javascript, we thought we'd be able to set up front end to do it. It didn't work. So we tried deploying to  


# What could you do next to improve it?
More interaction with user--- something to recommend pokemon based on ones they had already bagged. 

# What would you do differently if you did it again?
had baselines with jpgs in matplotlib--- aim for JS-rendered interactive plots as a stretch goal.

# And so on . . . (add other good prompts for others in the comments!)
